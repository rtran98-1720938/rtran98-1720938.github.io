                <p> This was the graphic used on New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Dominion 6.11.17 show, which was headlined with Kazuchika Okada defending his IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Kenny Omega. This is the second match between these two, in what would eventually become a legendary rivalry spanning a total of 4 matches. This match in particular saw the two battling it out to a 60-minute time limit draw. This match would go on to score 6.25 out of 5 stars from the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. </p>

        <p id="roundcorners">Rounded corners! To the right is The Witcher, which is a Netflix Original based on the book series of the same name. There's also Witcher video games, which I am a huge fan of. So you can only imagine how excited I was when I found out Netflix was making this. I absolutely binged the entire season in a day lol. Overall, really good show!</p>
